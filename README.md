# Procurement Data Processing Wizard

This project is a data processing wizard built with Flet and Python, designed to process procurement-related data from Excel files. The app allows for:

- Auto-mapping of Excel columns to predefined templates.
- Data cleaning and transformation such as calculating lead times, defect rates, and order statuses.
- Exporting processed data to Excel or CSV formats.

## Visualization
The processed data will be visualized using a pre-made Power BI file, which you can import into Power BI Desktop. This visualization provides insights into procurement performance, order statuses, defect rates, and other key metrics.

## Features

- **Auto-mapping**: Automatically match Excel columns to required columns for processing.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle issues such as missing values, invalid dates, and outliers.
- **Lead Time Calculation**: Calculate the lead time for procurement orders based on expected vs actual delivery dates.
- **Defect Rate Calculation**: Calculate the defect rate for goods received.
- **Export Options**: Export processed data to Excel or CSV format.
